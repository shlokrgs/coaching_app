# Align Coaching Web App (Frontend)

## Project Overview

The Align Coaching Web App frontend is a single-page application built with **React** and **Vite**. It provides the user interface for the Align Coaching platform, allowing coaches and clients to interact with the system via a fast and responsive web UI. This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **React Router** for client-side routing, **Axios** for API calls, and **React-Toastify** for notifications. The source code is organized in the `src` directory, and an import alias `@` is configured (pointing to `src/`) to simplify module imports. The app is configured to be deployed as a static site for production.

## Getting Started (Installation & Development)

**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have **Node.js v18+** and npm installed on your system.

To set up the development environment and run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:** If you haven't already, clone the Align Coaching frontend repository to your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies:** In the project root directory, run `npm install` to install all required packages.
3. **Start the development server:** Run `npm run dev`. This will start Vite's development server and compile the app. By default, the app will be available at **http://localhost:5173/**. Open this URL in your browser to view the application. (The development server supports hot-reloading, so any code changes will automatically refresh the app in the browser.)
4. **Explore the app:** You can now navigate through the applicationâ€™s pages and features. React Router is used for navigation, so you can use the app without full page reloads as you move between views.

## Environment Setup

If the application requires environment-specific variables (for example, API endpoints or keys), you should configure them before running the app or building for production:

- **Creating a .env file:** In the project root, create a file named **.env** (this file is ignored by Git). Define any needed variables in this file. For example, to set an API base URL, you might add a line like:<br>
  ```text
  VITE_API_URL=https://api.aligncoaching.com
